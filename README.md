# Title: Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Site Picture:
![My Site](images/Screenshot.png)

## Technologies Used:
- HTML: Used to create elements 
- Bootstrap: Used in the HTLM files
- Git: Used to document the changes of the source code
- GitHub: Used to create the repository for the html and css in which that can be pushed to GitHub domain

## Summary:
This assignment seemed to have a roll-over from the previous where we used the index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html and basically stripped all our css elements created and used Bootstrap in building the html files. Since I am using bootstrap, even though there is a style.css present, Bootstrap made the time in formating my html file documents much more efficient with the tools preset and given to me.

## Code Snippet:
```html
    <!--Beginning of where I begin writing my Bootstrap code for my about me section-->
    <div class="container" style="padding: 20px; width: 960px; background-color: white;">
     
 
                <div class="frontHead">
                    <h1 style="Font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman serif; Font-weight: 700; color: #4aaaa5;">About Me:</h1>
    
                            <hr>
                         <img class="img-thumbnail pull-left" src="assets/images/IMG_4124.PNG.jpeg" alt="Superman" style="height:300px; width: 250px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 50%; float: left;">
 
    
                    <p>My name is Andrew Duong. I am a Vietnamese-American who was born in San Jose and graduated from San Jose State University with MIS major and CS minor. On my free time, I enjoy spending time alone along with my family and friends in creating fond memories! Having overall 7.5 years of experience in TaeKwonDo, I enjoy anything the requires the body to move! Fishing and coastal foraging along the Pacific coast is something I will never get tired of as well! Even though I graduated in MIS, I plan on becoming a web developer and hone my skills on the coding end after completing this UCB Coding Bootcamp!</p>
